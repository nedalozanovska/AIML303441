1. Introduction

In this research, we develop a predictive model to comprehend and categorize virtual islands according to their degree of happiness using the "euphoria.csv" dataset. Features including the quantity of shelters, the accessibility of water sources, the size of the island, and the happiness score are all included in the dataset. In order to forecast and categorize islands according to their happiness score, exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing, and machine learning methods are used.

There are two primary components to the project:

Data Preprocessing and Exploration: To comprehend the dataset, visualize important trends, and find missing values and outliers, we start by doing a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA). To make sure the dataset is prepared for modeling, preprocessing procedures include handling missing data, encoding category variables, and scaling numerical features.

Model Construction and Assessment: Depending on the objective variable, we will classify the problem as either a regression or classification task after the data has been preprocessed. We will compare the performance of at least three distinct machine learning models, including Random Forest, Decision Trees, and Linear Regression. Cross-validation will be used for hyperparameter adjustment in order to guarantee that the optimal model is chosen.

In order to enable passengers to choose the best islands based on their tastes and the prediction model's findings, we plan to divide the islands into groups according to their degree of happiness throughout the project.
